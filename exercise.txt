Part B
-Read from imput a name of a file (invented by who is typing )
and save it inside a variable
-Create a file with that name using the variable 
-Create a file with that name and the prefix "1_" attached in front of it

	2)touch $name
	3)touch 1${name}
	

Part C 

In this Exercise we  focus on the difference between
variable expansion and command substitution.
Let's say that we want to record the exact time when we did
something in the terminal.

-Store the actual date and time using a variabe "important_time"
and check it
-Create a Variable "dd"  that execute the command "date". and 
check it

What is the difference between $imp_date  and   $dd  ?


solution:
	a)to save a perticular imp date in a variable
		1)imp_date=$(date)
		2)echo $dd
	
	b)variable to exicute date command :
		1)dd=date
		2)$dd

	the difference between these two are ,
		a)every time we have to run both 1 and 2 to change the value of imp_date,
		b)$dd is sufficient to get the current date
